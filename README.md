# Cube World / Plasma .plx file format(s).
Reverse engineering of the CubeWorld/Plasma PLX file format(s)

##### `plx_interface.ksy`
Can be used to parse the `interface.plx` file.  
Parses all of the fields, though the purpose of many of those fields are unknown.

##### `plx_normal.ksy`
Can be used to parse the remaining `.plx` files.  
Does _*not*_ parse all of the fields, only the general chunked structured of the file.
